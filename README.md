FAQ with COVID Dataset
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built during my internship at EPAM Systems. It allows users to ask COVID-related questions and get intelligent responses based on a curated FAQ dataset.

Project Overview
This application demonstrates a simple yet effective implementation of the RAG architecture. It uses a COVID FAQ dataset to build a vector database and leverages a language model to generate accurate, context-aware answers.


Features
- Semantic Search using vector embeddings
- Retrieval + LLM Generation
- OpenAI integration
- Streamlit-based interface for interactive querying

Tech Stack
Python, Streamlit, OpenAI, ChromaDB
